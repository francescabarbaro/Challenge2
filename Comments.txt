General Comments:
  - Review your comments. You forgot a TODO in the main file. Not supernice to see.
  - Instead of having a code with all the commented codes for the tests, I would have multiple files.
  - It is not nice to have the dimension of the read matrix hard coded.
  - operator() const needs to handle also the case when the element is not in the matrix and return zero.
  - Instead of the print() method, overload the operator<<.
